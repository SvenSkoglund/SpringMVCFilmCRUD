## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project

#### Description
A web-based application that linked up to a database about films. It allows users the ability to search up films by ID or a keyword. 

#### How this project works
* The user is prompted with three menu options: find film by ID, find film by keyword, or add film.
* If the user chooses the first option, they will be prompted to enter an ID
 * If a film with that ID is found, the film will then be displayed.
 * Otherwise it will display a message of Film Not Found.
* If the user chooses the the second option, they will be prompted to enter a keyword
 * If a film with that keyword is found, the film will then be displayed.
 * Otherwise it will display a message of Film Not Found.
* If they choose to add a film, they can choose the third option.
* Once the users are inside the program when their film is found or film is added, they have the option to edit or delete a film.
* There is also a button for them to go back to the home page.


##### Lessons Learned
* Double check spelling and punctuation
* Do .gitignore on .bin and .lock
* Merge conflicts

##### If we had more time, we would have
* Figure out how to debug in the server mode
* Made it prettier
* Add more functionality
