## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project

#### Description
A web-based application that linked up to a database about films. It allows users the ability to search up films by ID or a keyword. 

#### How this project works
* The user is prompted with three menu options: find film by ID, find film by keyword, or add film.
* If the user chooses the first option, they will be prompted to enter an ID
 * If a film with that ID is found, the film will then be displayed.
 * Otherwise it will display a message of Film Not Found.
